About the Project

This project is my personal idea to make Arabic typing simpler for people who want to learn it.

Each Arabic letter in the app plays its own sound when you press the corresponding key on your keyboard. I’m still a beginner, so please excuse any mistakes—but everyone has to start somewhere.

This project was inspired by Day 1 of the Wes Bos 30 Days JavaScript Challenge. I learned the basics there and then applied them to create something of my own.

I hope this project benefits others who want to learn Arabic typing as much as it helped me learn JavaScript.
